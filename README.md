# NationalParkCLI

Welcome to the National Park CLI gem! This gem allows users to see a list of every national park in the United States by state. Each search will yield the name and city of each national park in the chosen state. Users will also be able to dive deeper and request a bio of each specific park. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'national_park_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install national_park_cli

## Usage

Run the National Park CLI by entering 'ruby bin/console' in the terminal. Following the prompts output to the terminal, enter a state abbreviation to get a list of national parks in that state. Select a numbered park from the generated list to read a bio on the national park of your choosing. Continue to read about additional parks in the selected state by typing 'more' in the terminal. To quit the CLI, type 'exit' in the terminal. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
